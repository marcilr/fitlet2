Fanless


fitlet2 is designed with the failproof fanless cooling
that Compulab pioneered and has been refining for over
10 years:

1. Make an all-metal housing that is thermally conductive,
   and design it for effective convection cooling

2. Thermally couple the hot-spots (CPU, SSD) to the housing

3. Use the housing as the heatsink
