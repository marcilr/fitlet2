MintBox Mini 2    <=== Solid review
MARCH 23, 2018 BY CLEM
o completely silent and it has no fans or moveable parts
o front of the unit provides two USB 3.0 ports, audio and micro jacks and a microSD slot.
o front also has two LEDs, which can be Green, Orange, Green and Orange or which can be
  turned OFF.  This is done via GPIO.  If you know how to program or you’re OK with bash
  scripting, you’ll be able to take full advantage of this and use these LEDs as indicators
  (for incoming emails, internal core temperature, updates available… etc).
o faster USB 3.0 ports at the front for external storage devices.
o back we find the following ports: two USB 2.0, two Gigabit Ethernet, RS232 serial port,
  HDMI 1.4 (4K@30Hz) and mini-DP 1.2 (4K@60Hz).
o second HDMI port with a Mini DisplayPort makes the unit more versatile and allows it
  to connect to more than 2 monitors.
o Intel 8260 chipset provides WiFi 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2.
o RAM is upgradeable to 16GB
o CPU is a quad-core Apollo-Lake Intel Celeron J3455 with embedded Intel HD Graphics 500.
Nice review and details
